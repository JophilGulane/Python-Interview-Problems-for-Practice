## Updates

| Problem  |  Link |
|---|---|
| Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.  | [adjacentElementProduct.py](https://github.com/devAmoghS/Python-Interview-Problems-for-Practice/blob/master/adjacentElementProduct.py)  |
| Convert the string "123" into 123, without using the built-api `int()`  | [atoi.py](https://github.com/devAmoghS/Python-Interview-Problems-for-Practice/blob/master/atoi.py)  |
| Given an array , find if the number exists, develop a `recursive` implementation of the binary search. If the element is not found it returns -1  | [binary_search_recursive.py](https://github.com/devAmoghS/Python-Interview-Problems-for-Practice/blob/master/binary_search_recursive.py)  |
|  Bresenham Line Algorithm (BLA) is one of the earliest algorithms developed in computer graphics. It is used for drawing lines | [bresenham_line_algorithm.py](https://github.com/devAmoghS/Python-Interview-Problems-for-Practice/blob/master/bresenham_line_algorithm.py)  |
|  Find the no. of nodes in a BST that lies in a given range | [bst_nodes_in_range.py](https://github.com/devAmoghS/Python-Interview-Problems-for-Practice/blob/master/bst_nodes_in_range.py)  |
| Bubble Sort  | [bubbleSort.py](https://github.com/devAmoghS/Python-Interview-Problems-for-Practice/blob/master/bubble_sort.py)  |
| Find the angle made by the hour hand and the minute hand at any given time. Assume it is an analog clock  | [calculateClockAngle.py](https://github.com/devAmoghS/Python-Interview-Problems-for-Practice/blob/master/calculateClockAngle.py)  |
| Two strings of sizes m and n are given, we have to find how many characters need to be removed from both the string so that they become anagrams of each other | [check_anagrams.py](https://github.com/devAmoghS/Python-Interview-Problems-for-Practice/blob/master/check_anagrams.py)  |
| Find the numbers which are semiprimes, within a given range. A semiprime is a product of two prime numbers, not necessarily distinct. Squares of prime numbers are also semiprimes.  | [check_semiprime.py](https://github.com/devAmoghS/Python-Interview-Problems-for-Practice/blob/master/check_semiprime.py)  |
| Given a graph, there are two methods to perform traversal on it 1. Depth First Search (DFS) 2. Breadth First Search (BFS)  | [dfs_bfs.py](https://github.com/devAmoghS/Python-Interview-Problems-for-Practice/blob/master/dfs_bfs.py)  |

40+ Common code and interview problems solved in Python (it's growing...)

### The core idea is not to utilize built-in functions or library and giving it a more logic-based approach, so that it can be language-friendly and not end up being another repository of "Python Tips and Tricks" .

## How good is the code ?
* It is well tested
* Consistent formatting (using [Black](https://github.com/python/black))
* It can compile in its current state (and there are relatively no issues)

## How much support is available?
* FAQs (coming soon)
* Documentation (coming soon)
